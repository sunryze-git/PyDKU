# PyDKU
PyDKU is a future project I plan to begin work on imminently. It will be a full rewrite and recreation of AutoIDKU / BioniDKU, in Python.

## Supported Windows Versions
TBD

## Why Python?
I picked up Python back last fall when development on AutoIDKU was permanently ceased as I had no time, nor interest, to work on the project. However, with my new Python knowledge, PyDKU will be upon the horizon.

## What is the theme of PyDKU?
PyDKU will be based on a Synthwave 80s style of theming. Internal backgrounds will be under this theme and any music during the installation will also continue with this theming.

## When can I epxect the first release?
The first release will be very experimental and not feature complete. It will only be a basic recreation; there is a priority list I have to follow. The most important features will be added first.
